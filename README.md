Make Unique Plus
=========
Ruby plugin for Sketchup 8 Pro or above for making unique selected components depend of nesting levels.

USING
---------
Right click on component and/or group, or selected components and groups, and "Make Unique Plus". It has two submenus:

1. **_Only parent level_** - This will make unique all selected components without their nested levels. Any report or message are absent.
2. **_Choose nested level..._** - This will make unique all selected components and their nested selected levels components.

You can choose nested level from list. 2 level is parent. Report has three understandable options: 

  * *Off*
  * *Short in messagebox*
  * *Full in console*

**NOTE**. In SketchUp version 2014 or above console will be open automatically if it not opened yet. In other case you must open via *Window > Ruby Console*

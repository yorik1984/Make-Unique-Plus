Right click on component and/or group, or selected components and groups, and "Make Unique Plus". It has two submenus:

1. **_Only parent level_** - This will make unique all selected components without their nested levels. Any report or message are absent.
2. **_Choose nested level..._** - This will make unique all selected components and their nested selected levels components.

You can choose nested level from list. 2 level is parent. Report has three understandable options:
